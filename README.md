#Fitbit Case Study & Coding Challenge

Way back in the summer of 2015, I set out a challenge to myself to take a site that I thought was interesting, "cool", and appealing, and try and recreate it myself using the coding abilities I had. I am now migrating it over to this current site from my old one.

This project is a breakdown of a page off of the Fitbit website called Why Fitbit?

Note, since I did my breakdown, the site has changed, so please use the images below as reference.
